## Grasp information from websites

### File - Douban_Pageselecting.py

I planed to grasp moive information from douban.com according to the rates, then listed the output that combines web addresses of moives and rates. 

### File - Get_August_Customer_Reviews.py

The objective of the program is to grasp customers' reviews which wrote at August.

### File - Frequency_A_Author_Is_Quoted.py

How many times are one author quoted under a post? 

### File - Reviews_More_Than_1000.py

Collected at least 1000 TV reviews from a websites, like Amazon or Bestbuy, then stored all the reviews in a single file.

Steps:
1. List all links with the amount of reviews are more than 400. Select_Reviews_More_Than_400.py designs a step that collects all addresses and products.
2. Write down 3 functions to grab information like the full reviews, rates and submission dates. 
3. Use a loop for traversing the 3 links and append newly grabbing information to each list.

Problems:
1. The overrate and customerâ€™s rates share the same HTML tag on each review page
2. If a customers wrote down 2 or more paragraphs, more details will be involved in our processing.
3. Lists(ratinglist, reviewslist, datelist) should be preprocessed before write into a txt file: a encoding problem (\xa3); duplicated information; useless information
